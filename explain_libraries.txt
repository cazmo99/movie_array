Here are the libraries that I have used
creating this mobile application:

1. dio - HTTP client that helps connecting with third party API.
2. provider - used for state management.
3. get_it - used for the dependency injection.
4. stacked -  used as the base architecture. It is a MVVM architecture that is very efficent to use.
5. stacked_services - used to remove boilerplate codes. 
    Having a clean and readable code is the best a developer could do, 
    hat is why I am using this and 'stacked'.
6. build_runner - used for auto code generation when creating the app.dart.
7. stacked_generator - used to reduce boilerplate required setup of a stacked architectured application.
